Hey there!

Im TheZounder and I really enjoy cybersecurity and programming. I have no particular goals or pathway that I am taking, just having fun with it.

Currently know or am learning:
- Golang
- Python
- MATLAB
- C++

I am also currently studing physics at an unnamed university, hence the MATLAB.
