Hey there!

Im TheZounder and I really enjoy cybersecurity and programming. I have no particular goals or pathway that I am taking, just having fun with it.

Currently know:
- Golang
- Python
- MATLAB (sorta)

I need to brush up on everything except MATLAB really though

I am also currently studing physics at an unnamed university, hence the MATLAB.
